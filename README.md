# Linear Regression for Loyalty Scores Prediction - ABC Grocery

## Project Overview:
The **ABC Grocery Linear Regression for Loyalty Scores Prediction** project uses **Linear Regression** to predict customer loyalty scores based on transaction data and customer details. This project helps ABC Grocery understand customer behavior patterns and create data-driven strategies for customer retention, targeting, and marketing optimization. The model analyzes transaction history, spending patterns, and customer demographics to predict how loyal a customer is to the store.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a **Linear Regression model** that predicts customer loyalty scores for ABC Grocery based on historical transaction data and customer demographics. By leveraging the model, ABC Grocery can identify loyal customers, understand factors affecting loyalty, and tailor marketing efforts to improve retention.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned, unnecessary columns are dropped, and missing values are handled. Categorical variables such as **gender** are encoded using **One-Hot Encoding**.
- **Feature Selection**: **Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)** is used to select the most important features affecting the loyalty score.
- **Model Training**: The **Linear Regression model** is trained using the preprocessed data to predict the **customer loyalty score**.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using **R² score** and **cross-validation** to assess prediction accuracy and robustness.

## Methods & Techniques:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**:
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values are handled, and outliers in the data are detected and removed using **IQR (Interquartile Range)**.
- **Feature Encoding**: **One-Hot Encoding** is applied to categorical variables like **gender** to convert them into numerical features suitable for regression.
- **Data Split**: The dataset is split into input features (X) and the target variable (y), with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.

### **2. Feature Selection with RFECV**:
To improve model performance and avoid overfitting, **RFECV** is used for feature selection. It helps identify the most important features that contribute to predicting customer loyalty, ensuring the model uses only the most relevant data.

### **3. Model Training with Linear Regression**:
A **Linear Regression model** is trained on the preprocessed data, where the target variable is the **customer loyalty score**. The model is validated using **cross-validation** techniques to ensure that it generalizes well and does not overfit to the training data.

### **4. Model Evaluation**:
- **R² Score**: This metric evaluates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An R² score close to 1 indicates good model fit.
- **Cross-Validation**: **K-Fold cross-validation** is used to ensure that the model is validated on different subsets of the data, improving its robustness.

### **5. Model Visualization**:
- **Model Performance**: The model’s predictions are visualized by plotting the predicted vs. actual values, giving insight into how well the model fits the data.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the regression model and handling the data.
- **scikit-learn**: For **Linear Regression**, **RFECV**, **train-test split**, **cross-validation**, and **model evaluation**.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing the model performance and evaluation metrics.
- **pickle**: For saving the trained model for future use.

## Key Results & Outcomes:
- The **Linear Regression model** successfully predicts customer loyalty scores based on transaction data and customer features.
- The model’s performance was assessed using **R² score** and **cross-validation**, ensuring that it provides accurate and reliable predictions.
- **Feature selection** using **RFECV** helped improve model interpretability by focusing on the most important features.

## Lessons Learned:
- **Data preprocessing** is crucial for building accurate predictive models, as it directly impacts model performance.
- **Feature selection** is important in removing irrelevant or redundant features that may cause overfitting.
- **Cross-validation** is a vital technique for evaluating model performance and ensuring robustness.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimization of the model’s parameters could improve accuracy, such as experimenting with different solvers or regularization methods.
- **Advanced Models**: Exploring other regression models such as **Ridge Regression** or **Lasso Regression** to improve performance, especially if multicollinearity is present.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Deploying the model for real-time prediction of customer loyalty based on live transaction data could help ABC Grocery make dynamic, data-driven decisions.
